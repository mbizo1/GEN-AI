Create a folder for your project then open it on Visual code.

This project uses Python, so we need to install virtual environment "pip install virtualenv"

Create virtual env folder "virtualenv venv"

Activate the environment by typing it path "venv\scripts\activate.ps1"

Create files on the project folder. one backend.py and frontend.py

Streamlit library on the frontend.py file helps with creating frontends easily

Install COHERE so that you can make use of the API key for the chat model, "pip install cohere".

The code on ".env.sample" that is where you would insert the API key obtainable from COHERE for the model you choose to use.
